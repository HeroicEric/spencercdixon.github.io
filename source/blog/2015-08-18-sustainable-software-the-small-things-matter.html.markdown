Sustainable software is the difference between happy productive developers and

The idea of sustainability has been an omnipresent theme throughout my life.  It
really started to take root around the age of sixteen when I started my first
company [Great Lakes Aquaponics](http://www.greatlakesaquaponics.com) with my
father.  The whole idea of aquaponics is to create a mini sustainable
eco-system to grow plants and fish at the same time.  Pure harmony.  

> Aquaponics refers to any system that combines conventional aquaculture 
> (raising aquatic animals such as snails, fish, 
> crayfish or prawns in tanks) with hydroponics (cultivating plants in water) 
> in a symbiotic environment.

As a salesperson, sustainability meant building strong
relationships with my clients.  Not just doing a demonstration to make a sale
but to make a friend and hopefully a client for life.  One thing I 
quickly started to learn was that sustainable choices arn't always easy.

## The hard truth is: sustainability is fucking hard.

It requires patientence.  
It requires discipline.  
It requires long-term thinking.  
It requires creative thinking.  
It requires **purpose**.

Sustainable choices often require us to go against traditional thinking.  They
force us to divorce the idea of short term gratification for the less
destructive alternative.  They drain resources from our finite tank of daily
willpower.  

## So what does this have to do with software?
