React is a fantastic library to use in order to level up your JavaScript skills.
One of the main reasons I chose React over Ember was because it offered new
ideas that I thought would challenge me and force me to grow.  A lot of past
Rails contributors now work on Ember and they brought a lot of the same
philosophies to the framework.
